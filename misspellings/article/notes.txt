Comparison of Levenshtein with soundex
  Strengths and weaknesses of each, with examples

Combining Levenshtein with soundex

----

Basic interface for distance algorithms

class Dictionary {
    public String[] getWords();
}

class ScoredWord {
    String word
    int score
}

interface DistanceAlgorithm {
    public ScoredWord[] search(String word, Dictionary dictionary);
}

... for "hash" algorithms

class SoundexAlgorithm {
    public String[] search(String word);
    public void setDictionary(Dictionary dictionary);
}

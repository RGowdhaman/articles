Code and tests accompanying "Using XML Catalogs with JAXP"
----------------------------------------------------------

To run the tests using the supplied Ant build file you will need 
Ant and a JAXP 1.2 (or later) implementation. The ant file has been
tested with JDK 1.3 and 1.4 using the Java Web Services Developer
Pack 1.3. To use another JAXP implementation see the guidance notes here:
http://java.sun.com/developer/EJTechTips/2003/tt0311.html#1.

The command to run the tests is:

ant -Djaxp.lib.dir=<JWSDP_HOME>/jaxp/lib

    A bear is a large mammal of the order Carnivora, family Ursidae.
    The adjective, ursine, is used to describe things of
    bearlike nature.
    Common characteristics of bears include a short tail,
    excellent senses of smell and hearing, five un-retractable
    claws, and long, dense, shaggy fur.
    Bears have a large body with powerful limbs.
    They are capable of standing up on their hind legs.
    They have broad paws, long snouts, and round ears.
    Their teeth are used for defense and tools and depend on
    the diet of the bear. Their claws are used for ripping,
    digging, and catching.

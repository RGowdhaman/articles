    Cattle (called simply cows in vernacular usage) are
    domesticated ungulates, a member of the subfamily
    Bovinae of the family Bovidae. They are raised as
    livestock for meat (called beef and veal),
    dairy products (milk), leather and as draught animals
    (pulling carts, plows and the like).
    In some countries, such as India,
    they are subject to religious ceremonies and respect.
    It is estimated that there are 1.3 billion head of
    cattle in the world today.

    Alligators live in freshwater environments such as ponds,
    marshes, rivers and swamps. Although alligators have
    heavy bodies and slow metabolisms, they are capable of
    short bursts of speed that can exceed 30 miles per hour.
    Alligators' main prey are smaller animals that they can kill
    and eat with a single bite. Alligators may kill larger prey
    by grabbing it and dragging it in the water to drown.
    Food items that can't be eaten in one bite are either allowed
    to rot or are rendered by biting and then spinning or
    convulsing wildly until bite size pieces are torn off.
